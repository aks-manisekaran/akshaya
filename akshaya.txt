Tips
Markdown

You can style parts of the text bold, italic, or strikethrough using Markdown.

For example:

    Bold text is created by wrapping text with double asterisks: **bold**
    Italic text is created by wrapping text with single asterisks: *italic*
    Strikethrough text is created by wrapping text with double tildes: ~~strikethrough~~

Troubleshoot syncing

    After enabling sync, try writing some more text on all the devices.

How do I add the widget?

    iOS
    macOS
    watchOS

The widget does not show up in the widget picker, the widget is stuck, or is missing from the Home Screen

The iOS widget system is quite buggy and can fail a lot. This is not a problem with the app and out of my control. Try this.
The widget is blank

Try this:

    Restart your device.
    Change the language of the device to something else and then back.
    Ensure Lock Screen widgets are allowed to show content while the device is locked at “Settings › Face ID & Passcode › Allow Access When Locked › Lock Screen Widgets”.

Can you support having multiple pieces of text that change during the day?

I would like to keep the app simple, so it’s not something I plan to support built-in. However, the app comes with a shortcut action to change the text, so you could use the Shortcuts automations to change the text during the day.

You could also put multiple widgets in a widget stack.

(macOS does not yet have automations. You can use Shortery for now.)
